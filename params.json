Homework sets, papers I've authored,  Python programs, and blog posts are all fair game.\r\n\r\n### Python in Finance\r\nWe use Python in some of our classes, and here is some of my work:\r\n* [Basics notebook](https://github.com/pbenson/qfrm-bootcamp/blob/gh-pages/python-templates/python-basics-notebook-empty.ipynb)\r\n* [Secret notebook](https://github.com/pbenson/qfrm-bootcamp/blob/gh-pages/python-templates/python-secret-notebook-empty.ipynb)\r\n\r\n### 2015 The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling\r\n* [2015 ICM](https://github.com/Leodongxu/Leo-Li/blob/master/33695.pdf)\r\n  resume up to date\r\n* [resume](https://github.com/Leodongxu/Leo-Li/blob/master/resume.pdf)\r\n\r\n### About me and My interest in finance\r\nI am curious as most boys do, always crave an understanding of the underlying order of the nature and the world we live in. Great minds began from the dawn of civilization to seek to appreciate its age, size, volume, and beauty; but with what instrument? Mathematics and no others.\r\nMath is the most precise way to describe finance, at present and no doubt in the future to come. Born and bred in a well-off family, my mother is an accountant and my grandfather and my aunt are in high executive position at ICBC and CMBC. Figures,statistics, assets, currency, deficit and changing policy and etc. perhaps were the earliest words I picked up after the word ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad’ after mom and dad. A dinner table in my family is a debate over the nation’s economy and their price prediction over stocks and oil. At that time the computer were not available for most people in China, my grandfather had already brought me to VIP room of the equity trading market. I develop an interest for finance and formed the habits of organizing and reasoning. Naturally, when time came for me to choose my major, mathematics seemed to be the only rational choice, and computational mathematics I chose in School of Mathematical Science, Dalian University of Technology.\r\nThe greater the satisfaction, the stronger the willingness. Mathematics gives me a sense of accomplishment, as I score ‘A’ all the time and particularly good at solving geometry problem ever since the elementary. For me, solving complicated math problems is a process of innovation. Problems did occur in the college, for the knowledge acquired multiplied in depth and volume. At the beginning, I was too occupied in memorization\r\nand imitation of the courses I learned such as Mathematics Analysis, Linear algebra, Real Analysis and etc., which left me little time for comprehension. It took me a while to figure out that the ability of innovation can only be fabricated upon a concrete foundation of understanding the basic concepts and axioms.\r\nAlthough probability was not what I could brag about, I was deeply fascinated in probability model. For by the laws of probability model and stochastic process, we may still conceive the best strategy in a random condition. I took the patience and delight to study Introduction to probability models by Sheldon Rose. Every single chapter presented challenges; the ideas and models were hard to understand. But those interesting ideas constantly inspire me and give me a lot fun whenever I have the time to read the book. Several hours of reading per week lasted about six months, which brought me amazement that my brain got accustomed to different level of difficulty, the abstract and ambiguous theories became concrete and clear. That was the power of determination and accumulation and the passion for what I am really interested in.\r\nSo I continue my study at the University of Michigan and begin to systematically study how to use advance probability and statistic tools to analyze financial data to quantify the risks and make prediction in the market. \r\nPassion I have, and perseverance is in my character, When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena,then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature.\r\n\r\n",
